# ConservOcean-Copy
ConservOcean is a website that brings awareness to the effects of human actions such as pollution on bodies of water and fish.

### This repository is my copy of the final project so it does not show all the branches, issues, CI pipeline, and previous commits.

### To see the original repository use this link: https://gitlab.com/joewallery/cs373-group12/
